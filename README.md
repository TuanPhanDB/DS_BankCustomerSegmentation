### Bank Customer Segmentation

This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. 

Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, income, values, lifestyle, and more. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits. It will be interesting to explore the insights of the dataset. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice data science skills, which are:

- Understanding dataset features
- Perfrom cleaning and visualizing
- Analyzing features to find the insights
- Perform hypothesis
